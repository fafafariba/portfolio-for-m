          •  Hi, I’m Miad, a UX Designer based in San Francisco. I’m
          passionate about interaction design and building things that
          represent the perfect balance between creativity and analytical
          thinking. 
          <br />
          •  Since the age of 5, I have been experimenting with computers, video games, networking, security, programming,
          photography and design. 
          <br />
          •  When I’m not designing, I’m reading about design!
